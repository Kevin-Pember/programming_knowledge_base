- #Hashmap #String #[[Sliding Window]]
- Goal
	- Given two strings, s and t, find the minimum substring of s which has all of the characters of t in
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- Of course this is a sliding window algorithm so we known that our candidates for minimum substring form the window. But we need to figure out our triggers. We can keep a counter for all the characters of t and a more broad full count of all the chars in t. We decrement each for each char of t we find in s. Once the remaining_char reaches zero we have an actual candidate we want to shrink the window by advancing start until the char at the start of the window has a count in char_counter of zero once we have that we can check it against out minimum window. To cap it of we advance the start one more index to create a new window that only triggers when the targeted char renters the window. After this we just have to parse a minmum window to a string then we are done
