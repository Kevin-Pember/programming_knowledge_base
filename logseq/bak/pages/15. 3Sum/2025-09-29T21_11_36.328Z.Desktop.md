- #Array #[[Two Pointer]] #Sorting
- Goal
	- Given an array of numbers return an array of all the triplets which are independent values (each has their own index) and they add up to 0
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- It clear that we will essentially need 3 pointers for this problem but rather than changing the values of these pointers a random it seems like we need to sort the data. So lets sort the array in ascending order. After that we are going to traverse the array with our first pointer i. To prevent repetition we are going to check that the value at i is greater than zero and break the loop if it is. Since we are traversing the array starting at the negative values and our target sum is zero we know that once we have traversed all the negative and zero values there are no triplets in the positive values of the array that add up to zero. This isn't only values we want to limit we also want to prevent duplicate values from going thorough our logic so we can use the continue statement to skip an iteration in the loop. Ok once we have a valid value we want to create a left and right pointer as a part of a two pointer approach. From here we are going to treat this as a two pointer problem, advancing left and right depending if our sum is greater than or less than zero respectively. The difference comes when we encounter a zero sum, while we have found a value and we can add it to our return array we have an issue. Since there can be duplicate items in the array we need to advance or left and right pointers until they reach new values with while loops. This loops while checking the previous value also need to ensure that our pointers aren't over incremented so we use left < right. But this completes our logic all we need to do after this is our return statement after our initial traversal loop
